- We used WebSocket as server, JQuery as client
- Run on Tomcat Server at localhost

- Note: 
	+ Remember to import sql file.
	+ Change path in WSEnd.java (src/main/java/websocket), line 142 on handAvatar function. This is your project path (to save avatar of user)
	+ Change user and password of your local MySQL Workbench (src/main/java/repository) to get connection.
	+ Password of all user: khailinh1997
